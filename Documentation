//I struggled with the password generator a lot. I started off confused about how to generate letters and I was unable to figure out how to generate numbers so I used symbols in my generator to fulfill the principle of creating a strong and viable password. I used P5 reference online to learn the new functions and also watched videos on java to better understand the assignment. I know for the future that I can be a better student by asking for help and do everything in my power to complete the assignment. By learning how to still create a password generator despite struggling, I know now for the future I can do better by asking my teacher for help early on and possibly learning java better through codeacademy.
