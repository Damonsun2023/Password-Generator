The password generator is a project that I struggled with. Being the second project I took on, I had a limited understanding of the functions I needed to create a working password generator. This project not only helped me be more comfortable with arrays, but it also made me a better person in the regard of problem solving. I started off this project by doing what I know: the text and draw function to get words on the canvas. Then, I researched what makes a password generator and discovered I can use arrays to create one. I then went to P5 reference to learn about arrays and created a generator. I did not know how to limit it to numbers and letters and exclude symbols, however, I am proud I still created a project that serves the underlying principleof generating a password and know for the future on how to use basic arrays, problem solve, and revise code when necessary. Unfortunately, due to the due date I had to turn in a project that did not completely satisfy the requirements, however, I plan to revisit the project when I have more knowledge and create a better password generator.
